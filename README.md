# 📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard – Excel Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to analyze business data using **Excel Pivot Tables, Charts, and Dashboards**.  
Using the *Sample Superstore Dataset*, I built an **interactive dashboard** to track **Sales, Profit, Orders, and Profit Margin** across categories, regions, and time.  

👉 The dashboard allows dynamic filtering using **Slicers** and provides actionable business insights.
